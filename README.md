## Task 1

This was the first task assigned to us which covered basic C++ programming fundamentals such as loops, arrays and pointers. We then completed 4 tasks as practice to what we've learned.


## Task 2

In this task we Learned how to design a power supply circuit that converts high voltage AC to a lower DC voltage, how to implement current limiting for LEDs. Also developed skills in selecting and configuring batteries to meet specific power requirements, considering factors like cost, weight, size.

## Task 3

-   **Mine Detection:** Use a photoresistor to detect light from mines and trigger a buzzer when light is above a threshold.
-   **Mine Defusal:** Control a servo motor to defuse mines by moving in a specific pattern.
-   **Tank Movement:** Program the mini-tank to move in all directions using an L298N motor driver and two DC motors.
-   **Obstacle Detection:** Equip the tank with ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, printing a message when an object is detected.

## Task 4

In this task I :
gained experience in data handling by loading, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets. Learned how to implement basic chess logic in Python, handle game mechanics like piece movements and player turns, and create a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pygame library. developed skills in machine learning, focusing on regression models to predict weather conditions.


## Task 5

Learned to set up a secure communication system using Arduino, connecting devices via I2C and serial communication to relay messages securely.
Also how to convert analog signals to digital using different sampling rates and bit resolutions, and saw how these factors affect signal accuracy.


## Task 6

Learned to design an H-bridge circuit in Altium Design to control a 12V, 3A DC motor. Considered safety features like flyback diodes to protect the circuit and motor, understanding how to properly connect them for bi-directional motor control.
